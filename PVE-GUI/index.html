<h2>Proxmox VE 4.1 Brief Interface Tour <small>work in progress</small>
</header>
  <main>

    <p>Click the "launch" button below to have a (very superficial) tour of the Proxmox VE 4.1 Web admin interface, "pve-manager".<p>

    <p><em>The tour will launch in a new tab.</em></p>

    <p>Keep in mind, of course, that it is not complete. It's a draft of something I intend to put together more "professionally" in coming weeks.</p>

    <p>The final version will be as close to fully elaborated as the interface itself allows.
