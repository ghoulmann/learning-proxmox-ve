E. Gabriella Coleman's [*Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous*](http://www.versobooks.com/books/2027-hacker-hoaxer-whistleblower-spy) is such a tremendous success as a work of scholarship, and probably as popular reading as well: all the ingredients are there for both outstanding academic writing and feeding popular fascination.

Has it, though, displaced or dislodged Coleman's earlier anthropology of hacker culture (and Debian culture specifically), *Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking* from our minds? I hope not.

It's a seminal work, and belongs in the hands of as many high-school computing students as will accept it.

I don't want to see its value erased in the shadows of the success of *Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower...*....a phenomenal text. But a different text.

As a reminder, here's the ToC of *Coding Freedom*:
