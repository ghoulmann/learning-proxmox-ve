So pleased to say that I've submitted and had accepted all chapters of my current project for Packt Publishing, Ltd: *Learning Proxmox VE*, which will be available after the production phase as both an ebook and a conventional print book from Packt.

Late in the drafting stage, 4.0 beta was released, which saw some wonderful new features and improvements - and included a move from OpenVZ to LXC as the underlying container technology.

The book is now midway through the rewriting stage, which is done both in response to feedback and to take Proxmox VE 4.1 into account.

Almost ready for production phase. The release will follow about three weeks later.

I'll announce progress as it comes along.

In the meantime, learn more about the book:
