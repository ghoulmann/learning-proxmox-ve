The [_Anthology of Manifestos for an Information Age_](http://ghoulmann.github.io/manifesto-anthology/) was put together with high-school students AY 2014-2015, as much to practice critical reading and thinking as to work with reStructuredText markup and Sphinx.

Some notable omissions have been corrected:

CYBERFEMINIST MANIFESTO FOR THE 21ST CENTURY: (contains some language that wouldn't go over well with some parents) is now included.

McKenzie Wark's _A Hacker Manifesto_: should've realized (but did not) that there's an open version available. It's now included.

Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto: still can't decide whether to post in whole or just excerpts.
